# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-ignore-the-pods-directory-in-source-control?

# Pods/

# After making changes to this or any other .gitignore file, run
# Tools/generate_hgignore.py <path to this directory>.
